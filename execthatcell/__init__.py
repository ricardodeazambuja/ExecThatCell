  Parameters
  ----------
  label : str
      The label you gave to your cell. It will come just after cell_marker.
  cell_marker : str
      The signature indicating that comment is a cell label.
  latest : bool, optional
      Executes the latest version of the cell according to the last time
      the cell was executed. If latest=False it will execute the oldest version.
  exec_it : bool, optional
      When set to False (default is True) it will return the index of the cell
      without executing it. Useful when you want to easily catch exceptions by
      directly using exec(In[index]).
